## Inspiration
_How might we keep track of the "good old days" before we leave them?_
Take Knote was born out of the absolute mess of our camera rolls and message groups as our [nwPlus](https://nwplus.io/) crew travelled to Hack the North 2022. We had plenty of iconic moments and memories we never want to forget, and the way we're "documenting" our trip right now is simply not cutting it. 

Take Knote (the name and the app!) is inspired by two things:
1. Memory-keeping (ex. string around your finger to remember something)
2. Connection (ex. the red thread of fate between two people)
 
## What it does
Take Knote is a shared digital scrapbook for you and your crew to share, whether that's a significant other, your BFFs, or a beloved hackathon team. With Take Knote, you can enjoy an easy, straightforward experience in:
1. Memory-keeping with scrapbook entries of your outings, favourite moments, photos and notes
2. Planning with a wishlist for your outings, whether that's a cool new museum you saw on TikTok or a restaurant you've been dying to bring your friends to
3. Decision-making itineraries based on preferences in budget, mobility, food cravings or fun levels (for when your crew inevitably can't come to an agreement.

## How we built it
Take Knote is powered by the MERN stack:
- MongoDB to store our memories and wishlist destinations
- Express and Node JS
- React native
- Google's Places API and Google Maps for our destinations

## Challenges we ran into
- new technologies: first time with React Native mobile app, attempted to use CockroachDB Serverless
- first hackathon for half of our team!
- stomachaches, sleep deprivation and snoring roommates

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We made a mobile app!
- Really solid design from solo designer at her first hackathon (can you tell who's writing this?)
- Thoughtful brand concept 

## What we learned
- Mobile development skills
- API design
- Adaptability is very important in a short time frame
- Importance of good communication between design and developers
- How to work super speed like Lightning McQueen

## What's next for Take Knote
- Improving on our main flows and overall functionality
- Introduce a "year in review"/"wrapped" feature for your most frequented places
